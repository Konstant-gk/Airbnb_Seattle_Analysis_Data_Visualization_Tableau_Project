# Seattle Airbnb Data Visualization - Tableau Project

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data visualization analysis of the Seattle Airbnb market using Tableau. The objective was to transform raw Airbnb listing data into actionable business insights through interactive dashboards that reveal pricing patterns, property distribution, geographic trends, and revenue performance. The project demonstrates advanced data visualization techniques and analytical thinking to uncover meaningful patterns in the short-term rental market.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were to analyze the Seattle Airbnb market from multiple dimensions and create an interactive dashboard that provides stakeholders with clear, actionable insights. Specifically, the project aimed to understand pricing dynamics based on property capacity, examine the distribution of listing types and property categories, identify geographic pricing variations across Seattle zip codes, and analyze seasonal revenue trends throughout 2016. These objectives were designed to support data-driven decision-making for hosts, investors, and market analysts interested in the Seattle short-term rental market.

## Summary

This project involved a complete data visualization workflow from data preparation to dashboard creation using Tableau. I worked with a comprehensive dataset containing Seattle Airbnb listings, which included information about property types, room types, pricing, geographic locations, accommodation capacity, and booking data. The analysis process required careful data exploration, understanding of business context, and strategic selection of visualization types to effectively communicate different aspects of the market.

The project resulted in a professional, interactive dashboard featuring five key visualizations that collectively provide a holistic view of the Seattle Airbnb market. Each visualization was carefully designed to answer specific business questions while maintaining visual consistency and clarity. The dashboard reveals important market insights including the strong correlation between accommodation capacity and pricing, the dominance of entire home/apartment listings in the market, geographic pricing disparities across Seattle neighborhoods, and seasonal revenue patterns that peak during summer months.

## Results Summary

The data visualization project successfully transformed raw Airbnb data into actionable insights through a comprehensive dashboard. Key findings from the analysis include significant pricing variations based on accommodation capacity, with larger properties commanding substantially higher average prices. The market is dominated by entire homes and apartments, representing over 70% of all listings, while shared rooms represent a niche segment. Geographic analysis reveals notable price disparities across Seattle zip codes, with certain areas like 98134, 98101, and 98121 commanding premium pricing. The revenue analysis demonstrates clear seasonal patterns, with peak performance during summer months reaching approximately $2 million in weekly revenue, indicating strong demand during tourist seasons.

The dashboard effectively communicates these insights through a combination of bar charts, pie charts, and line charts, each optimized for its specific analytical purpose. The visualizations work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions about pricing strategies, property investments, and market positioning. The project demonstrates proficiency in data visualization best practices, analytical thinking, and the ability to translate complex datasets into clear, business-focused insights.
